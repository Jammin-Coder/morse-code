# Morse decoder/decoder 

To use this program, do:  
`python3 main.py`  
Then enter the mode:  
`>> Do you want to decode or encode [d/e]? >> `  
Use "d" or "decode" for decode mode, and "e" or "encode" for encode mode. 

NOTE: 
If you enter invalid morse code or a character that is not in the charset, the program will crash. 
Will fix this in the future.
